**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.
A platform designed to share, upload, and interact for adventurers who travel around the U.S. It can:

- Interact with other users by liking their photos
- You can share your own photos by clicking on the + button
- Edit your name and description of your profile
- Be used on any device (desktop, tablet, and mobile)

While the website is not fully complete for a user to share their journey, it is a great start for a personalized platform.

**What was used**

I implemented some advance HTML and CSS coding using the (display: grid;) property, allowing the website to properly format itself depending on the device it is being used on:

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
